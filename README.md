# csc-web-archive

A web archive for CSC students at Sac State. We all know how awful the computer science department is at this school, so I'm biting the bullet for any future students who come across this repository and uploading everything I have gathered to this site (notes, lecture recordings, exam study guides, assignment instructions, etc.). I also include my opinion on the professors that I took as well as an overall rating on the usefulness and difficulty of the courses separate from the professors that taught them.

I am thinking about adding non-CSC courses as well, but that will come at a much later date. Finishing the CSC course archives is my first priority, then adding others once they're all completed.

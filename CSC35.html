                <h2 class="mt-4">Course Summary</h2>
                <p>A course mostly focused on CPU architecture and the Assembly language. This was the most difficult pre-major course in my opinion, in part because of my professor's terrible performance and attitude. A list of the most commonly discussed
                    topics is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fw-bold"></li>
                    <li>Linear lists & multi-lists</li>
                    <li class="fw-bold">Binary to Hex Conversions (and vice versa)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>** The <b>topics in bold</b> were far more heavily covered and saw more frequent appearances on exams. Make sure to focus on these.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Devin Cook</p>
                <p>Professor Cook is considered to be a solid choice for most courses, but I had some serious issues with the lack of timeliness on grading and severe lack of feedback on assignments. After over 14 weeks of waiting, he began grading our assignments
                    at 1:00 AM on a Saturday and threw every student into a massive panick because the average scores were abysmal. Given there was only 1 week left of instruction, there was absolutely no way to fix our assignments in time for the end
                    of the semester since he waited until the last minute to grade them. His style of teaching is honestly very basic with him reading off of slideshows and occasionally demonstrating how certain algorithms work. He does make various attempts
                    at keeping the class interested in the subject by providing funny quips or videos on topics that would typically be considered highly boring. Though with these negatives out of the way, I personally think Cook is a great dude at heart
                    who has helped fill a small gap in the CSC department's HR problems. With very few quality CSC professors to go around at Sac State, Professor Cook allows the average student just enough leg room to get by without having to dedicate
                    40 hours per week on his class.</p>

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">A pretty useful course that teaches necessary algorithms and analysis skills but is cut slightly short by the lack of practice given to students. The first two assignments are far too large in scope and many students were overbooked with
                    just how demanding they were. Spreading out the assignments in smaller, more detailed modules would have led to a much more stress-free approach on the student's end. It is certainly helpful to understand how each data structure works
                    in theory, but without proper practice it's impossible to ever truly master the material taught in this course which is crucial for technical interviews. Try using HackerRank or Leetcode if you want to extend your knowledge of this
                    course to a more appropriate level.</p>

                <p>A reasonable course for computer science but one that comes a bit too early. For new coders, this course will be exceptionally difficult unless your understanding of programming is at least of a novice level.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 2 exams and 6 assignments</h4>

                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul><i>If you are not taking Professor Ghansah, you can disregard this next paragraph as my opinion on this part will be solely based on his performance.</i>
                            <li>The assignments in this course (at least for my professor) were just god awful. There is nothing you can do to properly prepare for them. You are essentially writing x86 assembly code for 16 weeks.</li>

                        <ul><i>If you are not taking Professor Ghansah, you can disregard this next paragraph as my opinion on this part will be solely based on his performance.</i>
                            <li>The exams were hot, tortorous garbage that not even death row inmates should have to endure. It was noted that at least 20% of the exams had no correct answers in the multiple choice sections and a few questions had such incredibly bad typos that it was borderline impossible for a human to achieve such a level of mistyping. These typos were so bad it caused the entire class to completely misunderstand the entirety of the exam itself.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Isaac Ghansah</p>
                <p>He is a genuinely terrible professor. Not even the most enthusiastic, bubbly, passive students will have the mental capacity to endure the absolute firey pits of hell that this man will send you into.
                    There is absolutely nothing you can do to obtain an A in this course with this guy. It is near impossible. If you have NO OTHER CHOICE but to take him, my only advice to you is to learn x86 assembly language on your own and you'll probably be alright.
                    Just know that his exams have nothing to do with code and are all questions about theory and concepts. You will need to chop off an arm and a leg to pass.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">It is difficult to write an objective review for this course because I think the material is important for computer science students to understand but my professor destroyed everyone's interest in it.</p>
                <p style="padding-top:5px;">Anyway, I think this course teaches some important concepts that are essential for any student pursuing a computing degree of any kind. Though primitive, it gives programmers a few flavors of low level programming and sets the stage for those who want to engage in careers that involve compilers, hardware engineering, and electronics. Some improvements that I think should be made include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Teaching x64 rather than x86. Intel's x86 architecture is ridiculously complex for undergraduate pre-major students to even attempt to comprehend.</li>
                        <li>Hiring more professors that have an understanding of modern architectures.</li>
                        <li>Not requiring a textbook. The internet is chock-full of resources to teach this material for completely free and at a much higher quality.</li>
                        <li>Not using Visual Studio to code in assembly. Please for the love of God let students use Linux instead of Windows for this class.</li>

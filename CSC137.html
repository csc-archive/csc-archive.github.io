                <p>A bit of an enigma among CSC courses, as not many CSC students find 137 to be particularly interesting nor useful since it only focuses on the hardware aspect of computers.
                    There are instances where you may implement some aspects of algorithm design or concepts derived from CSC130, but these are so few and far between that it's impossible to correlate other CSC material beyond CSC35 into the material taught here.
                    Though with that said, pretty much everyone passes this course with little resistance so no need to panic over this one, it's fairly easy.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The exams in this course were straight forward and mostly took from questions in the textbook. Nothing beyond basic understanding is required for the midterm. The final exam was a similar beast but necessitated a higher level of understanding; in most cases the final exam questions were just variations on the questions posed on the midterm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assignments were very long-winded and usually had about a 2 1/2 week window for you to finish each of them. This is more than plenty of time considering they only take about 3 hours each to complete. So if you finish an assignment the day it's assigned, you essentially have nothing to do for 2 weeks which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how well you retain information.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Harvin Singh</p>
                <p>Professor Singh (goes by "Harvey") is an extraordinarily friendly dude. His teaching style is very bland though, and he often tangents and digresses heavily from the topic at hand with random quips about his family or about life in general. He's super lenient on homework and does not seem to care if you attend class or not as long as you show that you understand the material. There isn't much to do in his courses as he assigns super lightweight homework and gives fairly easy exams. Nobody ever complains about this guy since the courses he teaches are mostly filler for the CSC major students anyway. Just know that once you finish a semester with him, you'll probably have learned very little but you will know pretty much everything about his personal life and random tech facts. He really likes talking about anything but the course material. He makes great coversation but teaches very little. Nothing to complain about unless you have some deep connection to the subject.

                An entirely hardware oriented course that may be interesting to some, but ultimately feels like a filler course that computer science students are forced to add to their schedules. It's very easy and is somewhat of an extension of CSC35 but without any code at all. No assembly language, just architecture. For CSE majors, this course will be highly beneficial. In my opinion, a better substitute for this course would be CSC154 (Cyber security basics) or CSC179 (Quality assurance) since these are highly sought after skills that every programmer should know. Plus, they're far more interesting to learn about. Regardless, this is considered a "free" course since it's easy and requires very little effort to pass so if you've got some extra difficult classes alongside this one, you will have plenty of room to focus on those instead of this one.

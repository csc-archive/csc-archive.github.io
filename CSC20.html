                <p>The parent class of CSC15 that teaches more advanced programming concepts and some basic algorithm design. This course is meant to be an extension of CSC15 and will naturally be more difficult.
                    Even for experienced coders, some concepts will be new and may be confusing. Ensure you spend most of your time studying the concepts that are new to you.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 5 assignments, 2 exams, and 1 project.</h5>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The first assignment is just a sanity check from CSC15 to see if you remember some key material. The other 4 assignments will be based on some easy algorithms and learning the Java API.</li>

                            <li>There is one midterm and one final. These exams tested concept understanding more than they did programming knowledge, so even experienced coders should be cautious of being complacent when studying.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>There is one semester-long project that you are meant to build on over time as you learn more about Java. The project topic was the same for every student: construct a movie database program that allows entry of new movies and deletion of existing movie entries. Restriction: you may only use a .txt file to conduct your reads/writes. Your project topic may be different than mine.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Matthew Phillips</p>
                <p>A fundamental course that serves as one of many locks to the gateway of Computer Science and is a pretty decent litmus test as to whether 
                    or not you'll enjoy the major. If you found this course to be overwhelmingly difficult, it's probably worth a shot to try again since many 
                    coders are turned away by one small failure when in reality they've had hundreds of successes. If you performed well in this course, you'll likely
                do well in most other pre-major courses as well. Phillips will be somewhat more indifferent towards CSC20 students who ask questions regarding material in CSC15
                as he expects you to already have most of that stuff mastered which isn't realistically the case for a good portion of students.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">A good course that teaches some high-level concepts about programming that can be confusing for students with less experience writing code. Though I found most of the information taught in this course to be fairly important and fundamental to the major, some concepts were just repeated in later courses like CSC130 and CSC28 which felt extremely redundant. CSC20 does a good job of testing coders of all experience levels and seeing how they fare through both application and theory.</p>

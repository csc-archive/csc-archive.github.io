                <p>An essential course that falls slightly short of modern expectations in terms of server and internet programming, but is nonetheless extremely useful. Many students find the material to be somewhat difficult but almost everyone passes. It should be said that this course is not a "free" course and will contain material that even the most seasoned programmer has not seen before. Be prepared to code and talk to servers a lot. Main language is Python (3).

                <h5>There were 2 exams and 10 assignments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exams
                        <ul>
                            <li>The exams are of about medium difficulty but were both curved as no student was able to reach a score of 100% on either. The midterm is about the same difficulty as the final, which is to say they both cause most students to struggle in some areas. Most questions were conceptual multiple choice questions like "what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6". The questions that caused most students to struggle required you to compile code in your head and determine the output. Prepare mostly for these ones, as the conceptual questions are easy to remember and will be worth the least points.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul>
                            <li>There were 10 assignments - one for each week. A couple assignments had two-week windows for submission so it isn't exactly one assignment per week but it is pretty close. Every assignment will involve heavy coding and a small written report meant to document your progress as you move through it. Luckily for anyone scared of strenuous coding, your code is only worth 25% of your assignment grade. The written report is worth 75%. Yup. You could technically write a bomb-ass report and write 0 lines of code and pass. Though it wouldn't exactly make sense to write a report on code that doesn't exist so you should at least try to finish the coding part. If you ever run into difficulty or just get stuck or give up, put your stopping point in your report. Your professor wants to know where you stopped and what things you tried before you got stuck/gave up. You'll probably get an A on the assignment if you do. I know I did this multiple times and finished the class with an A when I probably half-assed at least 4/10 of the assignments but wrote some really good reports and documented the parts where I got stuck.</li>

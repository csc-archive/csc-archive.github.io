                <p>A course that every college student must take to graduate. Most computer science students do quite well with math and this course shouldn't be very difficult to pass. Also given that the math professors at Sac State are of excellent quality, you can't go wrong taking pretty much any professor that is teaching it.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 14 assignments, 5 quizzes, and 4 exams</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul>
                            <li>The assignments in almost every math course you take will be hosted online through some third party site that grades everything for you. Unfortunately, most situations where homework is online will require you to purchase a ~100$ license to use the service which sucks. In addition, a textbook might be required but I've never run into a situation where the textbook isn't also included in the license you purchase for the online homework. For me, there was one assignment per week with only maybe 9 or 10 questions each so you retain the information but aren't overwhelmed with massive 50 question assignments.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Quizzes
                        <ul>
                            <li>The quizzes were held often at first but slowly died off as students gave feedback to the professor that it felt like too much to handle. They weren't difficult quizzes by any means but they took up a decent portion of what would be valuable lecture time so they stopped being given past week 8.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Exams
                        <ul>
                            <li>The exams were admittedly a bit harder than most of us expected but in all fairness, the professor did warn about all the topics that would be covered. The main problem was the time constraint we were on - 90 minutes for 16 calculus questions was barely enough for us to scrape by. Every student ended up passing in the end though, and our professor curved the final exam quite generously. Important to note: the midterm was very easy since it only covered basic knowledge. The material taught after the midterm will be suddenly very difficult to grasp which makes the final a bit unforgiving.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Drew Brinson</p>
                <p>Professor Brinson is honestly a role model for what math teachers and professors should be. He was extraordinarily kind and accomodating for students of all math backgrounds. I was genuinely surprised by how well he explains concepts. He shows every single step of work both complicated and simple. Whether he's demonstrating how to take an integral or simply adding 2+2 he will guide you every step of the way. He is also very tech savvy and even understands some computer science concepts which made examples and demonstrations highly immersive and interactive. Unless you just don't show up, it is pretty much impossible to fail any of Brinson's courses. One of Sac State's saving graces is their objectively excellent math department and Brinson is someone you should absolutely prioritize if you're weary about learning calculus. He'll make even the most stubborn students enjoy math.

Combine this with a common dislike for math, it can be intimidating. No matter your major, you are almost guaranteed to get a professor at Sac State that has incredibly good teaching skills and has the compassion to help you pass with minimal stress. Most STEM majors will use the material taught in this course in a higher-division course like statistics, engineering, biology, etc. so it's an essential one that will take you very far.</p>

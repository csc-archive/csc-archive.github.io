                <p>Your first course on computer logic that uses discrete math and some algorithms to teach some complex topics relating to recursion, encapsulation, relational logic, and more. If you get a bad professor for this course, just be warned it will be difficult.

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Herbert Mayer</p>
                <p>Professor Mayer is a very benevolent man who simply wants his students to succeed and nothing more. He's very kind when speaking to his students and has a very lenient grading style. Just attempting a homework question will usually warrant you most of the points if you show that you tried. I don't know of any students that have failed any of Mayer's courses. It is inconceivable that you don't get a passing grade in one of Mayer's courses because he treats his students like gods. Unless you legitimately do nothing. There is a clear reason why students are dying to get into his sections. If you need him for CSC139 like many students do, try applying for graduation and it should give you enrollment priority over everyone else so you can skip the waitlist BS.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">Another arguably fundamental course that teaches both philosophical and computer logic. There are a few topics that I feel were not meant to be included but since Professor Mayer was so lenient and focused on student learning, it felt like normal. Most of the topics are meant to prepare you for CSC130 and CSC135 although these courses won't be ready for you to take until you've finished another year of computer science. Because of this, a lot of knowledge fall-off was observed in CSC130 and subsequently CSC135 because this course is spread so far apart from the ones that require its knowledge.</p>

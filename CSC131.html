                <h2 class="mt-4">Course Summary</h2>
                <p>A useful course that teaches coding in groups. This course will consist mainly of you working with a group to code something cool. Every group will consist of about 5-8 people and you will take on a <b>real</b> client who is looking for some software to be made. That is where you and your group come in.</p>
                <h5>There are only 2 exams and 1 semester-long group project.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The midterm and final are the only exams you will take.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similarly to CSC179, the exams are very easy but some questions are impossible to answer bc the prof never goes over some topics presented on the exam (though getting above a B is almost guaranteed for every student).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The group project
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you're a CSC major, this is your first major group project that you'll definitely want to put on your resum&eacute; <b>especially</b> if you end up as team lead or do most/all of the work.
                            It is inevitable that some, if not all your group members will not know anything about the languages/tools required by the client in order to program your software. In my case, I used Java and some JavaScript. In CSC179 (an identical elective course to CSC131), I used mainly webdev languages like HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and GraphQL, but the required languages could be anything so be prepared to learn a lot.</li>

                <p>Depending on which section you enroll in, you will either meet on Tues/Thurs or Mon/Wed/Fri every week. As of Fall 2022, most courses are being held in person - 
                    if you are looking to attend online make sure to find a section that has either the "Hybrid" or "Web Online" modes of instruction shown on the student center.</p>

                        Views expressed in this section are solely my opinion and it is my goal to provide real, honest feedback with zero BS. Please take my words as one student's overall experience and perspective out of tens of thousands of others.

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Ahmed Salem</p>
                <p>Professor Salem is a very kind professor with an extraordinary level of flexibility towards his students. He is willing to accomodate students on almost anything as long as you ask. If you are going to be sick
                    on an exam day, he will let you take it at home at any time you like. If you need extra time on homework/deliverables for the project he extends it by a whole week just because you asked. Though his lectures and
                    handwriting are exceptionally messy at times, he is an outstanding example for the rest of the department for how a professor should treat their students. If you see his name on the student center on any course 
                    that you are trying to take, IMMEDIATELY ENROLL in one of his sections. I don't think most groups would have made it out of this course in one piece had Professor Salem not been the instructor for it tbh.

                <h5>Level of Difficulty</h5>
                <p>For me: 3/5 (dependent on how useful your group members are)</p>

                A good course that's an easy A if you pick a good group. The course material is mostly irrelevant to the group project and is almost never
                reinforced through any assignments. I had a terrible group so this course was significantly harder than I expected because all 6 other group members
                freeloaded off of my work and did nothing the whole semester. I had a few other team leads contact me asking for advice on what to do with useless group members 
                and I'm telling you (the reader) the exact same thing I told all of them - do not be shy to kick them out. <u>Do not settle for less.</u> Get rid of them.
                This entire course is the group project, if you pick a bad team you are royally screwed.</p>

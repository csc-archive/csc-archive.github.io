                <p>Another essential course that teaches students who have used Windows for the entire lives that Linux exists and can be useful for some development processes and coding in certain languages. This course will mainly focus on programming in C for everything.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 2 exams and 8 assignments</h5>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The first assignment is just a sanity check to ensure you set up your linux environment properly. The rest of them will be simple programming tasks in C, where the last assignment will test your knowledge on everything.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The usual midterm + final exam combo. The midterm was very easy. The final borrowed a lot of questions from the midterm which made it very similar in difficulty. The questions are all meant to be basic conceptual questions and there are a few questions asking you what a block of code does when executed.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: </p>
                <p>Since this was a summer course, he seemed to be in a rush to get us to learn the material but at the same time was very lenient as to whether we understood the material or not. Most concepts were boiled down to "this is how you do it in C, and I will ask you to repeat this exact same thing on the exam so there are no surprises." You can expect the exams to be fairly easy as most students pass this course the first time around with very little resistance. It's not meant to be a difficult one since it's the last lock in the gateway to the Computer Science major.
                    If you're just trying to pass this course without learning a lot, take this professor and move on to your upper division courses.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">A decent course that utlizes the prominence of Linux and the importance of the C language to engage students in a true development environment. Though it has a few pitfalls like attempting to teach some complex topics that pre-majors probably won't be able to understand, it's a good course that should be kept and has some great professors teaching it.</p>

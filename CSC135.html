                <p>Theory of Computation is notoriously one of the most difficult courses for Computer Science students and has not proven to be particularly useful outside of compiler construction/research. The topics covered in this course are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)</li>
                    <li>Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)</li>
                    <li>NFA to DFA Conversion</li>
                    <li>Regular Expressions & Operations</li>
                    <li><b style="color:orangered">The Pumping Lemma</b></li>
                    <li>Scanning in a Compiler</li>
                    <li><b style="color:orangered">Context-Free & Regular Grammars</b></li>
                    <li><b style="color:orangered">Push-down Automata</b></li>
                    <li><b style="color:orangered">Closure Properties of Context-Free Languages</b></li>
                    <li>Parsing in a Compiler</li>
                    <li>Turing Machines & Algorithms</li>
                    <li><b style="color:orangered">Decidability & Reducibility</b></li>
                    <li>The Halting Problem</li>
                </ul>
                <p>** The <b style="color:orangered">topics boldened in orange</b> were <u>very difficult</u> for many students to understand past a basic level compared to other topics. You may need to spend significantly more time studying these, as the
                    exams that cover them will be unforgiving.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="structure" class="container">
                <h2 class="mt-4">Course Structure</h2>
                <p>Depending on which section you enroll in, you will either meet on Tues/Thurs or Mon/Wed/Fri every week. My professor had a messy hybrid structure but this is the general structure of the lecture meetings.</p>
                <h5>Lecture Recordings</h5>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>I have uploaded all Zoom recordings for the entire course onto a YouTube playlist which can be found <a class="blue-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBpXCmBjXY6PCuytZR-G-9qW2miZE401B">here</a>. <br>Note that any gaps
                        in video recordings are likely because of holidays and class cancellations by the professor.</p>
                </div>
                <h5>Grading Scale</h5>
                <p>For most CSC135 professors, the minimum passing grade in the course is a 50% (C-) but even reaching this percentage is difficult for many.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Exams</h2>
                There were 4 exams that went in the following order:
                <ol>
                    <li>Short Exam #1</li>
                    <li>Midterm Exam</li>
                    <li>Short Exam #2</li>
                    <li>Final Exam</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The exams for my professor (Ghassan Shobaki) caused a considerable amount of fear to spread because of how difficult they are. He implements this really odd philosophy into his exams about separating intelligent students from the lazy
                    ones by putting ridiculously difficult problems on his tests as if some student with a hyper-ascended level of knowledge will just appear out of thin air and construct a compiler that cures AIDS and eliminates world hunger. Sadly to
                    say, very few students are passing out of the original enrollment roster. As of week 15 (16 week course), 10/28 students are currently passing.
                </p>

                    <b>UPDATE</b>: As of week 16 (finals week), far more students are passing because of the results from Short Exam #2. This exam was an exception from the rest because there were no difficulty classifications for any of the problems
                    presented and not a single student failed it. It was a much less stressful experience because the material was fairly straight-forward and did not require mountains of studying to prepare for which gave many students a much needed
                    confidence boost. In addition to this, after having finished the final exam I was glad to see there were no 'Hard' questions except for one that was worth 8 points. To my surprise, the final exam felt extraordinarily fair compared
                    to what I was expecting and I was able to answer most questions. I hope in the future he adopts the criticism I have provided in removing the 'Hard' problems or just simply making them extra credit. If he follows this advice, I would
                    go so far as to say he may become one of the best professors at this entire school. If he combines his excellent lectures with this one tweak in terms of exam style, students would be dying to get into his sections.
                </blockquote>
                <p>I've also seen and heard through students taking professor Parham Phoulady that his exams are nearly equally difficult. Phoulady conducts this really stupid social experiment with his students on his exams where he offers to give every
                    student 100% if 0 students attempt to take a test. How this is even allowed by the department, I have no f###### clue. If you are offered this same fate and are taking courses in-person, just simply block the entrance to the classroom.
                    If you are taking his course online, do not search for answers on Chegg or CourseHero or any source that gives out answers to schoolwork. He poisons the well by putting ridiculously difficult problems on his exams that no student should
                    know the answer to in an effort to weed out cheaters. Just take the exams with what knowledge of the material that you have and you'll probably pass since the intuition to cheat on extremely difficult exams will come naturally to the
                    students who don't heed this warning and it'll get massively curved once the cheaters all get zeros.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Ghassan Shobaki</p>
                <p>Professor Shobaki is a newer professor to Sac State, and recently moved from a University in the Middle East to teach computer science at this school. His lectures are objectively of excellent quality, minus a few hit/miss sessions every
                    now and then. Though with this one positive aspect out of the way, as implied previously, his exams make you feel like an idiot. I watched every single lecture recording in cadence with his in-person and online lectures that he gives
                    as a sort of 'supplemental discussion' period for students to further enhance their understanding of topics. But even as I found myself nodding my head and taking great notes on what he taught, when it came time for each exam I felt
                    powerless on many questions. He classifies every problem on his exams as 'easy', 'medium', 'hard' or combinations of the three like 'easy/medium' or 'medium/hard' and makes the hard questions worth the most points. Every student minus
                    one has not been able to answer a single 'hard' question on any given exam thus far. You best hope that you don't have any overperforming students in your section or you can kiss exam curves goodbye. Your grades are also posted publicly
                    for everyone to see, as proven by the spreadsheets found in <a class="text-primary" href="#notes">Notes, Files, & Links</a> at the very bottom.
                </p>
                <p>He also has this bizarre tendency to randomly mock people who don't show up to every in-class lecture and saying that they "do not deserve to pass if they are not here." The subject of full-on dropping out of CSC as a major has been brought
                    up numerous times by this professor as well. Blaming poor overall exam performance on his students' lack of intelligence rather than taking responsibility and catering the questions more appropriately suited for undergraduates.
                </p>
                <p>So in summary, he's a very good lecturer but needlessly rude to students who don't perform well or need help and has brutally hard exams.</p>

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">A stereotypically unuseful course that has some interesting topics smooshed into it. Considering that the textbook used for this course is called "Engineering a Compiler" you can probably guess what this course *actually* teaches. It teaches
                    compiler construction on a basic level and nothing more. Plenty of old heads in the field will tell you that this course is totally necessary and is something every student should have to take, but I strongly disagree with this narrative.
                    Studying primitive ways to code and construct programs is nice to know but certainly not a must-have skill in modern computing where everything is of high-level nature. With most courses in the CSC department, I've felt that I actually
                    obtained a useful skill through each one. But with this one, I feel as though I have not learned any sort of tangible marketable skill. All I can really say is that I understand how Turing Machines work which is what the material ultimately
                    leads up to towards the end of the class. It is a 16 week course on Turing Machines and compilers.</p>

                <p>Your first computer science course (probably) that will teach you the absolute basics and fundamentals of programming. More specifically, the basics of Java. Most students pass this course with no issues but find that the parent class (CSC20) is more difficult.
                    First-time coders will have some trouble with this class as there is a lot to take in if you've never used the tools necessary to produce code.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 9 assignments and 2 exams.</h5>

                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first assignment is just a test to see if you set up Eclipse (coding environment) correctly. No actual code is written on assignment #1. The other 8 assignments were basic coding assessments that even first-time coders should be able to knock out no problem.</li>

                            <li>One midterm exam and one final. The final is cumulative and covers everything. For first-time coders, the final will be slightly more difficult than the midterm but not by much. For experienced coders, both exams will be extraordinarily easy.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Matthew Phillips</p>
                <p>Professor Phillips is a kind dude who does game development on the side outside of teaching. He gets along very well with students who already have experience with code and somewhat struggles with those who have little to no experience.
                    Though it should be noted he does do his best to explain the basics to those new to computer science, having to explain concepts more than twice to the same student will frustrate him. He offers extra credit for all of his sections if you
                    playtest his video games that he has published on Steam.

                    A fundamental course that serves as one of many locks to the gateway of Computer Science and is a pretty decent litmus test as to whether 
                    or not you'll enjoy the major. If you found this course to be overwhelmingly difficult, it's probably worth a shot to try again since many 
                    coders are turned away by one small failure when in reality they've had hundreds of successes. If you performed well in this course, you'll likely
                do well in most other pre-major courses as well.</p>

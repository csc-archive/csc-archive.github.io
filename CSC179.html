                <p>A decent elective course for those interested in quality assurance or software testing. Most of this course is just another big group project making it nearly identical to CSC131.</p>
                <h5>There is only 1 exam and 1 group project.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only exam is the final.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mostly easy, but some questions are impossible to answer bc the prof never goes over some topics presented on the exam.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>Depending on which section you enroll in, you will either meet on Tues/Thurs or Mon/Wed/Fri every week. As of Fall 2022, most courses are being held in person - 
                    if you are looking to attend online make sure to find a section that has either the "Hybrid" or "Web Online" modes of instruction shown on the student center.</p>

                        Views expressed in this section are solely my opinion and it is my goal to provide real, honest feedback with zero BS. Please take my words as one student's overall experience and perspective out of tens of thousands of others.

                </div>
                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Ahmed Salem</p>
                <p>Professor Salem is a very kind professor with an extraordinary level of flexibility towards his students. He is willing to accomodate students on almost anything as long as you ask. If you are going to be sick
                    on an exam day, he will let you take it at home at any time you like. If you need extra time on homework/deliverables for the project he extends it by a whole week just because you asked. Though his lectures and
                    handwriting are exceptionally messy at times, he is an outstanding example for the rest of the department for how a professor should treat their students. If you see his name on the student center on any course 
                    that you are trying to take, IMMEDIATELY ENROLL in one of his sections. I don't think most groups would have made it out of this course in one piece had Professor Salem not been the instructor for it tbh.
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="blue">TL;DR if you need a CSC140+ elective and have no other good options left, this one should be your top pick.</b>

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">An okay elective course that's an easy A if you pick a good group. The course material is completely irrelevant to the group project and is never reinforced through any assignments.
                I had an excellent group so this course was not that bad and we outshined the rest of the class groups by a pretty stiff margin. But I had countless people contact me asking for advice on what to do with useless group members and I'm telling you (the reader) the exact same
                thing I told all of them. Do not be shy to kick them out. This entire course is the group project, if you pick a bad team you are royally screwed.</p>

                <p>If you like data science or are looking to specialize in this field, this course will be exceptionally useful for you. Generally, every computer science student should know the material taught in CSC134 because it's fairly simple compared to most other upper division courses. It's also super useful since it teaches you a new language (SQL) that you can add to your toolbelt.
                </p>
                <h5>There were 10 assignments and 2 exams</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignments
                        <ul>
                            <li>Like most CSC courses, the first assignment will just be another sanity check to ensure that you have your environment set up properly. The following 9 assignments will be SQL programming assignments that will get slightly more difficult as you progress through the semester. Though I didn't find the difficulty increased until around the 7th assignment. This is where you will learn more complex ways to query things in SQL and things can get confusing in some aspects. Two of the assignments (somewhere in the middle of the semester) will be "projects" which are really just two assignments combined into one. You will get double the normal time to complete both of them so there's nothing to stress about. They are just larger assignments with a longer grace period to turn them in.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>Exams
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is one midterm and one final exam. The midterm was <i>extremely</i> easy compared to the final although the time allotted for it was arguably not enough for many students, pretty much everyone passes CSC134 with little difficulty compared to every other course. The final will test the entirety of your ability to write queries in SQL and will test some conceptual knowledge regarding database structures and different analysis strategies. A very helpful resource for most students that my professor recommended was <a href="https://sqlzoo.net" target="_blank" class="text-primary">SQLZoo</a> which has some short and sweet tutorials on SQL queries that helped a lot of us pass.</li>

                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Haiquan Chen</p>
                <p>Professor Chen is a benevolent dude who comes off as a bit anxious when he teaches but he is genuinely very knowledgeable about data science and does a fair job of ensuring students understand the basics. He was more lenient on the first and last assignments since these are where the most difficult assignments will be considering the material will be brand new at the start, and will get very difficult by the end. There is a 99% chance you pass this course even if your programming skills are rusty and/or not as good as you'd like them to be because SQL is about as easy to learn as HTML and Chen's end goal is to make sure every student passes. I remember only a couple students failed the first exam and he curved it just to keep them in the section. Nobody dropped for the entire semester. If you can get Chen, he should be your absolute top pick for CSC134 and CSC180.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">A generally useful course that every computer science student should take as it teaches valuable data science skills as well as a new language that most developers use in the field. There are a few topics that could probably be saved for the advanced database course (CSC180 I think?), they are only introduced on assignments as extra credit and were not extensively seen on exams. I exited this course feeling like I had a new skillset that I could use on resum&eacute;s and in the field. Only a couple weeks after finishing, I landed an internship where I used SQL on the job and benefited greatly from the material I learned here. Excellent course that should be kept exactly as it is. Don't touch it CS department. And do everything you can to keep Dr. Chen.</p>

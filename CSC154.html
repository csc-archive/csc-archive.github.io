                <p class="fw-bold">My Professor: Jun Dai</p>
                <p>Professor Dai is not a terrible professor nor is he an amazing professor. But he is very lenient on grading and I've taken 3 of his courses and found them to be very easy compared to the nonsense that you may encounter with other professors.
                    He really hates when students don't understand most topics. Even if it's been 12 weeks since he last covered something, Dai will lose his mind if you ask a question about something he's taught already. Though other than this, he's not very present
                    in the classroom and generally does not care if you screw up a lab/assignment, he will still give you a passing grade on almost everything if you at least tried it. I remember not being able to reach a certain point in the 'Tikiwiki Penetration' hack
                    and he still gave me a 90% on my lab. As mentioned at the top of this page, you will spend 99% of your time on his labs. The material almost doesn't matter since you can find most answers to his exams already written out in his notes. Labs are 75% grammar and spelling,
                    25% screenshots of successful hacking. If you have decent writing skills, you won't need to do much to pass this course.

                <p style="padding-top:5px;">An honestly very cool course that teaches both ethical hacking and counter-measures to the most popular hacks that take place every day across the globe. If you are interested
                in cyber security or just need a really easy elective course to get the stupid elective requirements out of the damn way, this one should be near the top of your priority list. It should be said that the labs
                were heavily outdated, as they show exploits found over a decade ago and have been public knowledge for many many years. So while you will learn some basic hacking skills, don't expect anything crazy.</p>
